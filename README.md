Java Swing Calculator Application
Overview

This project is a desktop calculator application developed in Java using the Swing graphical user interface framework. It was created as part of Computer Science II coursework, with a focus on event-driven programming, object-oriented design, and GUI development.

Beyond basic functionality, the project explores elements of structured and expressive (esoteric-style) programming through creative UI behavior and modular event handling logic.

Academic Context

Developed for Computer Science II, this project demonstrates:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
